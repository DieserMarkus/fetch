    <i>React client + serverless backend for a collaborative event & item list</i>
</p>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

## What is this?

- Create events and add items that should be brought
- Share your events with your friends
- Everyone who has access to your event can work with you on the list
- You get an overview of who-brings-what

This is a [_Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree_](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990) capstone project using

- [auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/)
- [aws lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [aws dynamodb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb)
- [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Future

Maybe more features will be added, something like:

- Provide a generated event-add-id (e.g. [stackoverflow: generate human-readable unique ids](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9543715/generating-human-readable-usable-short-but-unique-ids))
- Provide a tiny URL to directly add an event
- Provide a QR-code to directly add an event
- Drag & drop to add images, without entering edit mode
- Add default images for well known event events and items (e.g. festival, camping, pizza, beer, ...)
